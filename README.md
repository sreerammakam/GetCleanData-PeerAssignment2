## Peer Assignment2, reading Train and Test datasets and merging into one file with the required measures – std and mean.

## Step1, selecting the two colums with stg and mean into a new data frame
# Using feature.txt file to get the names and subset to features having mean or std in their names

## Step2, read train and test folders having X axis files
# Get the train and test feature sets and subset only the desired features

## Step3, merging the two datasets into 1 using rbind function

## Step4
# Attach column names to merged dataset

## Step 5
# Read and combine the train and test activity codes for the Y axis

## Step 6
# Get activity labels and attach to activity codes

# Step 7
# Get and combine the train and test subject ids

# Step 8
# Combine and name subjects and activity names

# Step 9
# Combine with measures of interest for finished desired data frame

# Compute New Result
# From the set produced for analysis, compute and report means of 
# all measures, grouped by subject_id and by activity.
